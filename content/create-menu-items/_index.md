To create hidden menu item, you need to create it inside a menu which is not assigned to any menu module so that this menu is not displayed on your site.

For example, you create a new menu `Hidden menu`, in this menu you create menu items for Coupon detail and Merchant detail page. Now this menu and these 2 menu items are available but they are not displayed on your site at all.
